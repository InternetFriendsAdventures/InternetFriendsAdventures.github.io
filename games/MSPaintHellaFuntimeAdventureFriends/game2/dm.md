 <b>MAP</b>
 This is the most recently updated map. Who knows how old it is.

Only significant landmarks are marked here. To the west there is the Cleptsy fire, to the east there is a molested pile of sticks, and up north, a 5 minute walk from the shore line there is a boulder outcropping nearby a small clearing. In that clearing there is an "L" shaped house made of sticks (by archie).
