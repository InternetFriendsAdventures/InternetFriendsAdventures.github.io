# What
This is a fun little site that was set up so that a few friends and I could keep track of some role playing adventure games that we play VIA teamspeak. 

# Why
This site will include things like character sheets, crudely drawn maps (and I do mean crude), and other information about the game world.

# How
Each game we play will have it's own index page, and from there you can branch out and find the rest of the information. Nothing is final, so we will work out the kinks as we go.
